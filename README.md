# Olympus Wifi-Enabled Camera on Linux, macOS and Windows

Some Olympus cameras have wifi capability. Photos can be downloaded from them;
they can also remote control the camera: the live camera picture is
transmitted and they take pictures and modify settings via wifi.

This repository provides Python code to connect to a wifi-enabled Olympus
camera, set the camera's date and time, download images, watch the live camera
view in a window, take a picture, change camera settings, and turn off the
camera. In addition, command-line arguments allow to send user-specific commands
to the camera.
